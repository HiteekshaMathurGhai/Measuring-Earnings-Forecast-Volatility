# Measuring-Earnings-Forecast-Volatility
Information Asymmetry measured by Earnings Forecast Volatility affecting Corporate Spinouts 

There is potential information asymmetry between managers and outside market before a corporate spinout (a project/team becoming a new company from within the existing firm)
Measured using:

•	Forecast error in earnings- ratio of abs diff between forecast earnings and actual earnings divided by price per share at beginning of month 

•	Std deviation of forecasts-standard deviation of all earnings forecasts made in the last month of the fiscal year preceding the spin-out announcement year- represents dispersion among analysts indicating lack of info

•	Normalized forecast error-ratio of the forecast error in earnings to the earnings volatility of the firm (to confirm that forecast err is not related to riskiness of the firm- but to the info asymmetry) [Earnings volatility is the standard deviation of the firm's detrended quarterly earnings in the five-year period before the announcement of the spin-out]

The data was downladed from CRSP.
